# Steps:

1. Identify and document the functional and non-functional requirements from
   stakeholder requirements.
   System requirements are written from the perspective of the technical system
   but still fulfil the stakeholder's needs.
2. Ensure the requirements are
    1. Verifiable,
    2. unambiguous,
    3. free from design or implementation details,
    4. not contradictory with any other requirement.
3. Structure and prioritise the requirements
4. Analyse the requirements and their interdependencies for:
    1. correctness,
    2. feasibility,
    3. estimated complexity and cost.
5. Analyse the impact of the architecture on the system context (operating
   environment).

### System requirements specification

- System requirements include: functions and capabilities of the system;
  business, organizational and user requirements; safety, security,
  human-factors engineering (ergonomics), interface, operations, and
  maintenance requirements; design constraints and qualification requirements.
  (ISO/IEC 12207)
- Identifies the required system overview
- Identifies any interrelationship considerations / constraints between system elements
- Identifies any relationship considerations / constraints between the system elements and the software
- Identifies any design considerations / constraints for each required system element, including:
    - memory / capacity requirements
    - hardware interfaces requirements
    - user interfaces requirements
    - external system interface requirements
    - performance requirements
    - commands structures
    - security / data protection characteristics
    - application parameter settings
    - manual operations
    - reusable components
- Describes the operation capabilities
- Describes environmental capabilities
- Documentation requirements
- Reliability requirements
- Logistical Requirements
- Describes security requirements
- Diagnosis requirements

- **Requirement type:** {{business function, organisational function, user,
  safety, security, ergonomic, interface, operational, maintenance, design
  constraint, qualification}}
- **Interaction:** system elements / software, nature of interaction
- **Constraints:** resource limits; performance constraints; safety, security expectations; interface and API constraints
- **Operational and environmental limits and capabilities:**
- **Documentation:** where it is, what it is for.
- **Safety related:** yes/no
- **Auditable:** yes/no

### Verification Criteria

- Each requirement is verifiable or can be assessed
- Verification criteria define the qualitative and quantitative criteria for
  verification of a requirement.
- Verification criteria demonstrate that a requirement can be verified within
  agreed constraints. (Additional Requirement to 17-00 Requirements
  specification)
