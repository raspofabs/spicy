# Requirement design in general

1. Ensure the requirements are
    1. Comprehensible,
    2. verifiable,
        - can you stimulate the system as a unit?
        - can you observe the output to determine whether the system behaves as expected?
    3. unambiguous, explicit, and precise,
        - could the requirement be misinterpreted?
        - does it specify enough? i.e. is it so simple it's subject to perverse interpretation?
    4. free from design or implementation details,
        - Is the requirement limited to the scope of the requirment type?
          (System requirements do not mention software architecture, or define
          stakeholder needs or requirements)
    4. feasible,
        - Is the requirement possible to achieve in within the organisational,
          practical, and other constraints?
    5. not contradictory with, or duplicating, any other requirement.
2. Structure and prioritise the requirements
3. Analyse the requirements and their interdependencies for:
    1. correctness,
    2. feasibility,
    3. estimated complexity and cost.

Requirements include:

- functions and capabilities of the system;
- business, organizational and user requirements;
- safety, security, human-factors engineering (ergonomics), interface,
  operations, and maintenance requirements;
- design constraints and qualification requirements.
